# youtube-hide-watched

A simple userscript for toggling watched videos in the YouTube subscriptions list, in right recommendations sidebar or on the main page.

The script is published on GreasyFork at: https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/13040-youtube-hide-watched-videos

# Installation

- Install TamperMonkey or GreaseMonkey extension for your browser
- Visit https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/13040-youtube-hide-watched-videos and hit the Install button
- Visit YouTube (or refresh the YouTube page if it's already open)

# How to Use

The script adds a small button at the top of the page. Pressing the button cycles through showing watched videos normally, then dimmed, then entirely hidden. The state of the button is configured per page which allows you hide watched videos on the Subscriptions page, but keep them visible on the Trending page.
